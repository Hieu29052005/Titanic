# Titanic Data Science Project

The Titanic data science project involves analyzing historical data from the RMS Titanic disaster to predict survival outcomes of passengers. Participants use a dataset containing features such as passenger demographics (age, sex, class), ticket details, and embarkation information. 

## Objectives
- **Predict survival**: Build a predictive model that estimates whether a passenger survived or perished based on various features.
- **Data analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and insights within the dataset.
- **Feature engineering**: Handle missing data and create meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Model evaluation**: Evaluate and fine-tune the model to ensure accurate predictions.

This project is popular for teaching data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques. It provides valuable practice in handling missing data, feature engineering, and evaluating model performance.
